### Selection criteria and justification of selection
#### Hypothetical Project Scenario
This project using the borough tree list dataset (referred to as “trees dataset” throughout this repo) involves a group of 4-5 UCL students with some data science/computer science experience who would create a dashboarding web app for The London City Hall. The web app would include multiple dashboards to manage the planting and maintenance of London Borough trees (further explanation under “Definition of Business Need”). 

#### Selection Criteria & Justification of Selection
Given this scenario, I considered the following selection criteria for the project methodology:
- **Requirements of the Project** – As we are creating a dashboard, it is possible to develop a base dashboard and small features frequently over time. A methodology with shorter time in between team meetings (i.e. 2-4 weeks) would work best in this situation. 
- **Volatility** – The project methodology is not likely to change over time. We have one set deliverable as opposed to multiple deliverables requested by the client over time, which may vary in nature. 
Experience of the team with data science methods – Management Science students such as myself are familiar with the flow of data science projects, however, have likely not formally used a methodology for our coursework. Some team members such as myself may be familiar with the agile methodology from past internships in development teams.
- **Size of the project team** – A smaller team size works well for the scope of the project as we would all be working towards a single deliverable, rather than multiple separate and different deliverables, making the daily standups relevant for all team members. A smaller team size also means that daily standups from each member would not take too much time. In my experience in a team of 10 using scrum, the daily standup could take up to 40 minutes and not all content discussed was relevant to everyone, which is nonoptimal for time management. This issue would be ameliorated by having a smaller team, which is the case for this project. 
- **Schedule Constraint**s – Given that we are university students and also have to manage coursework, exams, and our personal lives on top of this project, it would be better to have a methodology with shorter time between team meetings so that team members can better manage time.

I decided to select the scrum methodology for my project based on the above selection criteria and prior experience using it in my Summer internship at Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, I am familiar with technologies used to manage development projects that use an agile approach. Using Jira (ticket task manager) and Bitbucket (like GitHub) allows the sprint tasks to be displayed to all team members, categorized, and even linked to specific branches, commits, builds, etc.

#### Potential Concerns
Some potential concerns with the agile methodology is that it is difficult to catch up on tasks once the sprint is over. In my experience at DB, there were often times where tickets would get lost in the backlog while team members had to move onto the next sprint. Since my team at DB was bigger and we were managing multiple different projects, we could not afford for all team members to stay behind a sprint in this case. Having time constraints for each sprint poses the concern that the project may get disorganized if team members are not able to complete all their tasks in time. Despite this, I still think that the frequent check-ins that the agile approach allows is best for managing a development project around university students’ lives. Furthermore, it is possible that all team members could stay behind a couple days before starting the next sprint as we would all be working on the same project with the same deadline.
